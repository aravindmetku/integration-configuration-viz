# integration API Visualiser

## How it Works?
1. Simply copy your integration API connector in 'Connector' editor section **(Processors should have unique processors names)**
2. Click on 'Processor' to work with individual processor. Each processor type is **color-coded**.
3. If you have the output of a integration API run, copy in 'Output' section to quickly visualise which processor have error.
4. Click on the 'Processor' to get **specific errors for that processor**.

## Points to Remember
1. Every processor should have unique name 
2. Get in touch with us to improve this!
